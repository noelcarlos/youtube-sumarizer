## YouTube Video Summary: Ranking Public Speaking Advice

The video's host, who has over a decade of experience learning, failing, and teaching communication skills, ranks common public speaking advice. He clarifies that "public speaking" encompasses any situation where you speak in public, whether to one person or many. The advice is ranked from S (best, original, Apple-like) to F (worst, copycat, Android-like), with intermediate tiers (A, B, C, D, E).

### S-Tier (Best Advice)

*   **Use Pauses:** Pausing gives the audience time to process information, making communication more impactful and thoughtful.
*   **Smile (Slightly):** A subtle, slight smile can profoundly change how the world perceives you. Most people unconsciously have a slight frown, so a 2mm change can make a significant difference in appearing friendly and approachable, without looking like a "serial killer."
*   **Record a Video of Yourself Speaking:** This acts as a "communication mirror," revealing visual and auditory ticks and non-functional behaviors that you're unaware of, thereby dramatically improving communication skills by allowing self-correction.
*   **Tell Stories to Connect with Your Audience:** Connection is paramount. Stories make information "sticky," build a foundation of rapport, and make your message more impactful and influential than simply delivering content.

### A-Tier (Excellent Advice)

*   **Don't Start with a Joke (Unless You're Naturally Hilarious):** Starting with a joke is high-risk, low-reward. If it falls flat, it kills energy. It's only effective for naturally gifted comedians or those whose humor perfectly aligns with the topic.
*   **"Fake It Till You Become It" / "Practice It Till You Become It":** This is a useful belief. By consistently practicing desired behaviors (e.g., confident behaviors if you're shy), you can actually internalize and embody those traits.
*   **Name the Elephant / Call Out the Obvious Thing:** Acknowledging awkward situations or significant mistakes (e.g., a major stumble) upfront is crucial. For minor slips, don't make a big deal out of it, and the audience won't either. But for substantial errors, address them directly.
*   **Don't Eat Before You Go On Stage:** A large, carbohydrate-heavy meal before speaking diverts energy to digestion, making you feel sluggish, less quick-witted, and mentally slower during your presentation.

### B-Tier (Good Advice, with Nuance)

*   **Don't Completely Avoid Filler Words:** Striving for absolute perfection in avoiding "um" or "uh" can make you sound robotic and overly scripted. A few filler words (e.g., one per minute) make you sound more human and conversational.
*   **Share a Statistic or Fact as an Attention Grabber:** While it can be an incredible way to hook an audience, it can also be boring if overused or used in the wrong context. The speaker personally prefers starting with a story for more engagement.

### C-Tier (Mediocre / Lazy Advice)

*   **Just Be Yourself (on Stage):** While well-intentioned, this is often lazy advice. Being "yourself" in a natural, one-on-one setting differs greatly from an unnatural situation like speaking to a large audience. It requires significant practice, dedication, and mastery to maintain your natural charisma and composure under pressure, as fear can constrict body language and vocal variety.

### D-Tier (Bad Advice)

*   **Use Big Words to Sound Intelligent:** Overly complex language doesn't make you smarter; it makes you harder to understand, hindering effective communication. While occasional sophisticated vocabulary might be appropriate, avoid fabricating the illusion of "cerebral magnitude."
*   **Don't Move Your Hands (When Speaking):** This is terrible advice. Hand gestures bring messages and stories to life, help chunk information for better audience absorption, and enhance engagement. The only time to avoid hand gestures is when you are *listening*.

### E-Tier (Worse Advice)

*   **Tell Everyone You're Nervous at the Start of Your Presentation:** This is "you-centric" and adds no value to the audience. Public speaking should be audience-conscious, not self-conscious. Focusing on the audience's needs helps reduce personal nervousness.

### F-Tier (Worst Advice)

*   **Imagine Your Audience Naked:** This is the "worst advice ever" – inappropriate, unhelpful, and potentially problematic.
*   **Memorize Your Speech Word for Word:** This is terrible advice because forgetting even one word can cause you to fall apart. The audience doesn't know your script, so don't put this unnecessary pressure on yourself.
*   **Put Lots of Text on Your Slides So You Remember Your Speech:** Slides are for the audience, not a teleprompter for the speaker. Excessive text on slides is distracting and ineffective.
*   **Look Over the Heads of Your Audience (for Eye Contact):** This is unengaging and ridiculous, creating a disconnect rather than fostering connection with the audience.
*   **Practice, Practice, Practice (without Review):** "Practice makes permanent," not perfect. Without reviewing your practice, you risk ingraining bad habits. The effective cycle is to *practice, review, then practice again* to continuously improve.
*   **Never Use Notes:** Many great communicators, even those who appear seamless, use notes, often subtly hidden or integrated. Using notes is human, reduces pressure, and enables better delivery.
*   **Don't Rehearse; Just Wing It:** This is disastrous advice. "Winging it" prevents growth and impact. Rehearsal allows you to know your content thoroughly, freeing up cognitive capacity to focus on present delivery, engagement, and influence, making you sound *more natural* and impactful, not less.
*   **Use a Podium:** A podium creates a physical barrier between the speaker and the audience, hindering connection and engagement.
