## YouTube Video Summary: Four Peptides for Enhanced Productivity and Well-being

Michael Zoo, the Nootropic Reviewer, discusses four peptides he consistently uses to achieve greater productivity. He emphasizes that the majority of peptides are understudied, necessitating a calculated approach that considers potential benefits, side effects, and long-term consequences. His methodology involves reviewing user experiences, analyzing existing studies (even if limited to non-healthy subjects or animals), and conducting personal experimentation with common sense. He cautions that peptides are "unbelievably potent" and there are "countless stories online about specific peptides doing irreversible damage."

### 1. CMAX

*   **Primary Benefits:**
    *   Improves focus.
    *   Increases learning speed.
    *   Decreases anxiety.
    *   Provides benefits without being stimulating (unlike caffeine), leading to a feeling of being a "better version of yourself" with a 20-30% boost in productivity.
    *   Enhances alertness and motivation, and reduces overthinking.
*   **Mechanism:** Increases levels of **BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)** in the brain, which acts like "fertilizer for the brain," promoting neuroplasticity and faster learning (similar to benefits seen with exercise).
*   **Unique Selling Point:** Helps with both learning and focus, along with anxiety reduction, which many other nootropics don't offer simultaneously.
*   **Common Serving Size:** 400 micrograms (mcg) up to 1,000 mcg once per day.

### 2. Selank

*   **Primary Benefit:** Decreases anxiety.
*   **Similarities to CMAX:** Both were developed by Russian scientists, have similar serving sizes, and are commonly taken via nasal spray.
*   **Speaker's Perspective:**
    *   Rarely used due to its high cost.
    *   Prefers nootropic supplements like Ashwagandha or L-Theanine for anxiety issues.
    *   Views it as a compound for calmness and peacefulness, rather than motivation or business success.
*   **Versatility:** Works well with other nootropic compounds, and users typically don't experience withdrawals.
*   **Caveat:** Effects are often very subtle; many users report not noticing anything and regretting its use. It requires extreme sensitivity to one's state to perceive effects. Potentially worth experimenting with if anxiety is a significant concern.
*   **Common Serving Size:** 200 mcg to 300 mcg once per day.

### 3. Newept

*   **Nature:** Many are surprised this powerful compound is a peptide, being many times stronger than racetams.
*   **Primary Benefit:** Exceptional for **execution** and getting more tasks done (e.g., sales calls, videos, work). It helps focus on priorities, avoid distractions, and maintain the "boring, repetitive life" necessary for long-term success. The speaker attributes significant business success to Newept.
*   **Stimulation:** Non-stimulating; can be taken in the morning or closer to bedtime, providing an alertness boost for 2-3 hours.
*   **Side Effects:** Can slightly **increase anxiety** for some individuals (tolerable for the speaker, but too much for others). Some users also report a worse mood. The speaker notes that individuals typically know quickly whether they respond positively or negatively.
*   **Cognition:** Not ideal for memory enhancement or faster learning (CMAX is a better option for these benefits).
*   **Common Serving Size:** 20 to 30 milligrams (mg) throughout the day. The speaker personally uses 10 mg sublingually twice daily (morning and late afternoon).

### 4. BPC-157

*   **Primary Focus:** Highly popular for **wound healing, recovery from injuries, and alleviating joint pain**, rather than cognitive enhancement.
*   **Speaker's Use:** Utilizes it for faster recovery after strenuous workouts (e.g., heavy weightlifting, HIIT, leg day) or when experiencing joint discomfort, such as knee pain.
*   **Impact on Peptide Awareness:** It's one of the most popular peptides and has brought significant attention to the potential benefits of peptides for humans, especially given the limited research.
*   **Research & Anecdotes:** Eye-opening research shows its ability to accelerate wound healing in animals, and there are numerous positive user experiences reported online.
*   **Usage Pattern:** Not intended for daily use; it is typically reserved for instances of injury or when accelerated healing is required.
*   **Tolerability:** Generally well-tolerated with few concerns about side effects.
*   **Common Serving Size:** 100 mcg to 200 mcg once per day.
